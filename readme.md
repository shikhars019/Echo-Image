<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

This is a demo project to explore OpenAI APIs - it uses gpt-4-turbo's vision capabilities to describe an image and then uses the image description to get a similar looking image from DALL-E.

### Prerequisites

You will need an OpenAI account and a secret key to run the project locally. Once you have it, add it to .env file inside the server folder.

### Installation

Below is how you can run the e2e application

1. cd server -> node server.js
2. cd client-app -> npm i -> npm start
